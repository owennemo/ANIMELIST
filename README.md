# ANIMELIST
(UNCOMPLETED)

Hi, everyone.

In this Repository I learned to create an anime list website called "ANIMELIST" along with the information in it which was obtained through a tutorial from one of the Indonesia Youtuber programmer, namely Dea Afrizal (https://www.youtube.com/@deaafrizal).
Here are some things I learned in this project & tutorial:
1. How to create Next.js project app (Without Typescript, pure Javascript)
2. How to create Component 
3. How to Implement Best Practice Foldering Structure (Combination between Tutorial + Documentation)
4. How to consume / use Public API - JIKAN API (https://jikan.moe/)
5. How to use Tailwind CSS to Styling
6. How to create custom Styling to Tailwind CSS, which is reusable
